# Vectornator Inspection

## About
Vectornator Inspection aims to convert .vectornator / .curve files into SVG.

## Motivation
Popular Illustrator alternative app Vectornator has changed its name to Linearity Curve.

Vectornator offered all of its features for free. However, with Linearity Curve, most of them have been paywalled, **INCLUDING SVG/PDF EXPORT.**

This means Curve documents cannot be exported without compromising quality.

All of my works on Curve can no longer be exported with layer structures intact. It is such a bummer.

So in this project, I want to make a converter for Vectornator files, so that all of my projects are safe.

And once this is working, I might make an Inkscape extension that can import such files.
